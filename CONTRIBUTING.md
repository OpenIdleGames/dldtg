# How to Contribute

* Changes should be based on the master branch, not the gh-pages branch.
  Small changes can be
  commited directly but larger changes should be in their own branch.
* All changes should pass jshint check without adding additional
  warnings or errors and without changing jshint settings to achieve
  this result.
* Do not use any source code compression/minification/obsfucation tool.
* By contributing you are asserting that you are the creator of your
  contribution and that you are waiving all copyright claims to that
  contribution.
* Be kind and considerate in all your communications. Determinations
  of violations of this policy will be at the sole discression of the
  repository owner.
