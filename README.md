# Digital Logic Design (The Game)

Digital Logic Design (The Game) combines elements of traditional
incremental games like Cookie Clicker with more complex elements
designed apeal to someone interested in clicking less and thinking more.

In this game you will take on the role of a digital logic designer.
You will be presented with designs you must implement using logic gates.
The design will be simulated to verify that your implementation fulfills
the requirements. Then you will be able to sell your design to generate
cash to purchase upgrades and additional designs.
